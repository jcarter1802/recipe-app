- Unit normalisation so “g”, “gram”, “grams” all merge cleanly
- Fraction support for things like “½ cup” or “1/4 tsp”
- Plural handling (“clove” vs “cloves”, “tomato” vs “tomatoes”)
- Category grouping (produce, dairy, spices) to make the list even more shopper‑friendly
- Export to clipboard so you can paste the list into your phone notes
- Recipe scaling (double a recipe, halve it, etc.)
But for now, enjoy the win — you’ve got a tidy, intellige
